# About me

I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in computer science within a Computer Graphics (CG) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) research group, where I focus on developing my skills in scientific computing and preparing for a career that bridges physics and computation with an emphasis on practical applications.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in Nuclear Technology and Nuclear Engineering. While I was initially drawn to theoretical nuclear physics, I gradually realized my interests aligned more with computation. To support coursework, I self-studied programming and explored scientific computing, including a formative project on relativistic hydrodynamics. Although unfinished, this experience strengthened my technical foundation and sparked my lasting interest in CFD.
