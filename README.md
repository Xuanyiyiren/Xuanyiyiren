# About me

I was an undergraduate student major in nuclear science, and I started programming at the end of my sophomore year, as nuclear engineering was very limitedly taught in my university, and nuclear physics is now a part of high-energy physics, whose party has been over. So I decided to switch my field to computer science. I am mostly self-taught.
